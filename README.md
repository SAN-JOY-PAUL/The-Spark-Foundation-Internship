<h1>Internship-Tasks</h1>
<h2>This is one of the tasks given to us in the internship we are doing with The Sparks Foundation i.e GRIP(Graduate Rotational Internship Program)</h2>

<h1>Task-1</h1>
<h2>Prediction using Supervised ML</h2>
<lr><li>Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.</li>
<li>What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?</li>
<li>This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.</li>
<li>Dataset : http://bit.ly/w-data</li><lr>

<h1>Task-2</h1>
<h2Prediction using Unsupervised ML</h2>
<lr><li>From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.</li>
<li>Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox </li><lr>

<h1>Task-3</h1>
<h2>Exploratory Data Analysis-Retail</h2>
<lr><li>Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’</li>
<li>As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit.</li>
<li>What all business problems you can derive by exploring the data?</li>
<li>Dataset: https://bit.ly/3i4rbWl </li></lr>

<h1>Task-4</h1>
<h2>Exploratory Data Analysis-Terrorism<h2>
<lr><li>Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Global Terrorism’</li>
<li>As a security/defense analyst, try to find out the hot zone of terrorism.</li>
<li>What all security issues and insights you can derive by EDA?</li>
<li>Dataset: https://bit.ly/2TK5Xn5 </li></lr>

<h1>Task-5</h1>

<li>Dataset:https://bit.ly/34SRn3b </li></lr>

<h1>Task-6</h1>
<h2>Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm</h2>
<lr><li>Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.</li>
<li>The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.</li>
<li>Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox </li></lr>

<h1>Task-7</li>
<h2>Stock Market Prediction using Numerical and Textual Analysis</h2>
<lr><li>Objective: Create a hybrid model for stock price/performance prediction using numerical analysis of historical stock prices, and sentimental analysis of news headlines</li>
<li>Stock to analyze and predict - SENSEX (S&P BSE SENSEX)</li>
<li>Download historical stock prices from finance.yahoo.com</li>
<li>Download textual (news) data from https://bit.ly/36fFPI6</li></lr>

<h1>Task-8</h1>
<h2>Timeline Analysis : Covid-19</h2>
<lr><li>Create a storyboard showing spread of Covid-19 cases in your country or any region (Asia, Europe, BRICS etc) using Tableau, Power BI or SAP</li>
<li>Use animation, timeline and annotations to create attractive and interactive dashboards and story</li>
<li>Identify interesting patterns and possible reasons helping Covid-19 spread with basic as well as advanced charts</li>
<li>Screen-record the completed storyboard along with your audio explaining the charts and giving recommendations.</li>
